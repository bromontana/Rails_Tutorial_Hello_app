# The Ruby on Rails Tutorial

I am learning Rails with [The Ruby on Rails Tutorial](https://www.railstutorial.org/book/). 
In the tutorial there are three different apps that are
built: 

 + *hello_app*
 + static_app
 + sample_app

## hello_app 

In the hello_app we learn about the relationship between 
routes and controllers. We also learn about how to deploy
an app for the first time as well as how to modify the 
Gemfile to help us control what modules we add into our
new app.
